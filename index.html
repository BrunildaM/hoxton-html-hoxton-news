<h1>Just in</h1>

<h2>A new cohort just started!</h2>
<br>
<p>Ready to tackle the challenge, new group of Hoxton students charge on!</p>

<h1>Our mission</h1>
<p>“Our mission is to make a better world through education. I am very excited to be working on a curriculum and methodology that will not only teach students the latest technologies they need to know to thrive in the industry, but will ultimately shape them into great problem solvers and communicators, providing them with skills that will prove extremely valuable throughout the rest of their careers,” says Nicolas Marcora, Headmaster at Hoxton Academy.</p>

<p>The industry standard today relies on a very simple recruitment process: applying for a job means going through the process of being interviewed, completing a CV or sharing experience. If a software engineer has not pursued an education at an elite university, they are faced with the challenge of proving their talent. According to Stack Overflow data, 87% of software engineers say they have learned how to program by themselves.</p>

<p>Through Hoxton, the Innovation and Technology Ecosystem will undoubtedly become richer, more competitive in the region and an encouraging signal to the talents of our country that the future belongs to us and here, and that from here we can change the world. </p>
